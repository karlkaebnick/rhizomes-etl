Felipe Archuleta trained as a carpenter and in 1943 joined the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. He felt the union didn’t give him enough work to support his wife and seven children, however, so he asked God to give him a talent. He started carving a few days later and soon developed a distinctive range of animals with exaggerated body proportions, fierce faces, and sharp claws.

He grew interested in ceramics through a course at San Francisco City College, where he met ceramist Peter Voulkos. After serving two years in the Army, Neri returned to the Bay Area, where he abandoned ceramics in favor of plaster. He felt that clay was too limiting, whereas plaster was “a mere blob,” allowing him to work quickly and spontaneously (<i>ARTnews</i>, Jan. 1981). Although art after the war was dominated by abstract expressionism, Neri swam against the stream and focused on human forms and gestures. He considers the human figure a “blank canvas” through which he can express different ideas (<i>Corcoran Day &amp; Night</i>, March/April 1997). Starting with a plaster mold of a model, Neri chips away at the surface and hacks at the limbs. He then paints the figures with expressionistic brushstrokes of color, explaining that the ancient Greeks painted their sculptures too.</p>",Artist,,,1930-4-12

She was the first person in her family to finish high school, and went on to enroll in religious studies and art at San Diego State University. She started as a painter, but became interested in fiber art while in college and soon turned all of her attention to weaving and textile design. Underwood imbues her pieces with powerful messages about her Chicana heritage, creating images that call attention to the dangers that Mexicans face trying to cross the border into the United States in search of a better life.</p>",Artist,Consuelo J.

When he was young, he was mixed up in drugs, alcohol, guns, and fast cars and had several run-ins with the police. In 1990, however, he was involved in a serious car accident that changed his life. The accident put him in a coma, during which he saw a <i>muerte</i> (death figure) by his great-uncle Jos&#233; In&#233;s Herrera at the end of a tunnel of light. He believes this image brought him out of the coma and that God intended for him to become a saint maker (Awalt and Rhetts, <i>Herrera, Visions of My Heart</i>, with essay by Charles Rosenak, 2003). Saint makers, or <i>santeros,</i> create devotional paintings and carvings of saints for use in churches and in private homes. Herrera makes crucifixes, death figures, and saints as well as sculptures inspired by modern issues such as police brutality and the dangers of nuclear power.</p>",Artist,,,1964-7-11
